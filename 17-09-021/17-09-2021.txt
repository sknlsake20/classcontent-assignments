user - collections

	
	
	servlets :

		1. rewriting URL
		2. hidden forms		
		3. cookies

		-> they are very fast.But once user disables cookies in browser.
		-> only texual message can be sent,


		4. httpsession
		-> object can binded
		-> set with time interval and last accessed time.

		session.invalidate();


	-> Cookie :it is a small piece of information that is persisted between multiple client until removed.

	-> javax.servlet.http.Cookie


	Filters:
		-> it is preprocessing and postprocessing of a request.

		ex: 
			validation, logging, compression, encrypt and decrypt.

		-> filters can be pluggable

		-> recording all incoming request
		-> logs all ipaddress who are giving request
		-> conversion
		-> data compression
		-> encryption and decryption
		
	API's:
		-> Filter
		-> FilterChain
		-> FilterConfig


			init() -> doFilter -> destroy()


	Events & Listeners:
		
		Event:
		-> it is a basic occurence when state of an object changes.

		ServletRequestEvent -> servlet request object is generated
		ServletContextEvent
		SevletRequestAttributeEvent
		ServletContextAttributeEvent
		HttpSessionEvent
		HttpSessionBindingEvent

		Listeners:
		-> it is used for automatically performing certain opertions depending on even.

		ServletReqestListener
		ServletReqestAttributeListener
		ServletContextListener
		ServletContextAttributeListener
		HttpSessionListener
		HttpSessionAttributeListener.


JSP : 
	Java server pages.

	-> these are written on servlets.
	-> these contain more functionalities and advantages then servlets
	-> using jsp's we can avoid restart server many times.
	-> these are very simple understand.
	-> less code when compared to servlet.


	Life cycle:
	-> translation of JSP page
	-> compilatin of Jsp page
	-> Load classes
	-> instantiate an object 
	-> initialize object(jspInit())
	-> service method execution(_jspService())
	-> destory (jspDestory())

	Servlet -> JspPage(jspInit(), jspDestory())-> HttpJspPage (_jspService())
	
	Ways of writing java code in JSP :
	1. scriplet tag
		<% out.print("welcome to jsp pages");%>
	2. expression tag
		<%=java.util.Calendar.getInstance().getTime%>
	3. declaration tag

		<%!   int square(int n)
			{
				return n*n;
			}


	implicit objects:

	out -> JspWriter
	request -> HttpServletRequest
	response -> HttpServletResponse
	config -> ServletConfig
	application -> ServletContext


	session -> HttpSession
	pageContext -> PageContext
	page -> Object
	exception -> Throwable

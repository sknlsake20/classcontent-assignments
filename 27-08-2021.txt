	java 8 features:

		-> Functional Interface
		-> Lambda Expression(java.util.Function)
		-> Method References

	Method Reference:
	-> this features provides reference to function interface methods.

	Types of Method Reference:
	1. Static method 
		BiFunction<Integer,Integer,Integer> bi = Operators::add;
	2. instance method
		bi=new Operators()::div;
	3. constructor reference
		Displayable dp=Message::new;


	Optional:
	-> it is used to deal with NullPointerException

		Optional<String> cnull=Optional.ofNullable(str[i]);


	StringJoiner:

	-> it used for giving sequece of string using delimeter-> , - #

		StringJoiner sj=new StringJoiner("-");
		StringJoiner sj=new StringJoiner("-","{","}");


	Base64:

	-> it is generally used for encoding and decoding

	Base64.Encoder en=Base64.getEncoder();

	Base64.Decoder de=Base64.getDecoder();


	Java Nashorn :
	it is a java script enigne.


	Default & static method in interface:

	Default:

	- These methods are declare mainly inside Funtional interface which are defined to provide certain services for abstract methods.

	Static methods:
	- these methods are declared inside interface to define services to all implemented classes.

	Stream API :
		-> this api contains many classes, interfaces and enum whicch provided funtionalities to access collection, maps , arrays using functional interface support.
		-> it is mainly used of processing group of elements.

		

	ex: 
		collection -> even numbers to be separeted.
	
		-> java.util.stream;
		-> it is used for processing mainly collection objects like a pipeline.

		Stream s= collection.stream();

		-> filter(Predicate p)-> it is used to optimize values form collection

		-> collect() -> it used for collecting any type data.

- Write a program to accept student objects and separate student who have age great than 18.  name, id, age.

MYSQL:- 

	java -> student -> 100 students -> I/O operations
		
	Data -> relational information 
		stdid   studentname

	Database -> the way organizing data is called database.

	Rdbms and non Rdbms : 

	database management system:
		-> it is application or software where data can be managed like 
			adding, removing, update
	RDBMS :
	-> relational database management system
	- it is a software or application where data is stored in form of table structure
	- Mysql, sql server, oracle.....

	-> NON - RDBMS:
	- it is a software or applicatin where data is stored in form of grphical or map represenataion
	- mongodb, cassandra, bigdata..... 
	

	Server : 
		-> it is a system or software where applicatin is hosted and executes depending on request and response. 
		-> web server
		-> appliation server
		-> database server

		- server which hosts any kind of rdmbs or non-rdbms softwares.

		local database server:
		- server which hosts rdmbs or non- rdbms application in our own systems.

	-> SQL : 
		- Structured query language.
		- these are commands which can used to interact with DBMS by user.

	-> database users:
		- user who interact with database.
		- types of users:
			- DBA
			
			- naive/ parametric end user
			- System analyst
			- sophisticated user
			- database designer
			- application user
			- temporaray user

	-> DBA:
		- they define the schema and also contorls repairs, create special ussers, recovery or backup

	-> Parametric end users:
		- no knowledge about dbms but they frequently use database application

			ex: swiggy users, ticket booking etc

	-> System analyst:
		- these team analyze the requirement of end users and they send satisfactory results
	
	-> sophisticated user:
		- who have knowledge about databases and depending on requirement use sql queries to get data.

	-> Database Designers:
		- special organized to define schema like tables, indexes, views, constraints etc.

	-> Application Program:
		- using other languages they try to manage DBMS.

	-> Temporary users:
		- occasionally use the database but each time access database they require. 

	MYSQL : 
		
	-data is oraganized in form of tables i.e., rows and cols.
	- it is an open source.
	- it is a powerful program which can handle larger set of data
	- it is very fast and quick
	- it supports many operating systems
	- it is very friendly
	- it is standard form and well formed
	

	history:
	- it is found by michael widenius 
	- it started in year 1979
	- mysql 8
	- 2018
	
	Names to tables, columns , database:
	Datatypes:
	- they specify storage space it takes with fixed length.
	- it is type of values it represents.

	types of datatypes:
		-> Numeric data type

			TINYINT -> -128 TO 127
			SMALLINT -> -32768 TO 32767
			MEDIUMINT -> -8388608 TO 8388607
			INT -> -2147483648 TO 2147483647
			BIGINT-> -9223372036854775808 TO 9223372036854775807

			FLOAT(M,D)->M IS FOR LENGTH , D IS FOR NO. OF DECIMALS(24)
			DOUBLE(M,D)-> DECIMALS(53)
			DECIMAL(M,D)
			BIT(M)-> M -> 1 TO 64
			BOOL -> 1 IS FOR TRUE, 0 IS FOR FALSE
			BOOLEAN -> 

		-> Date and time data type

			YEAR(2|4)-> 
			DATE -> YYYY-MM-DD
			TIME -> HH:MM:SS
			DATETIME-> YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
			TIMESTAMP(M)

		-> String data type
			CHAR(SIZE)- 255
			VARCHAR(SIZE)- 255
			TINYTEXT(SIZE)- 255
			TEXT (SIZE)- 65535
			MEDIUMTEXT(SIZE)-16777215
			LONGTEXT - 4,294967295
			ENUM - 65535
			SET - CANNOT HAVE ZERO, NO DUPLICATES(64)

		-> Binary Large object data type(BLOB)
			TINYBLOB 
			BLOB(SIZE)
			MEDIUMBLOB
			LONGBLOB


		-> json data type:
			json documents

		-> statial data type:
			POLYGON
			GEOMETRY.......


	variables
		-> used for storing data or infomation while execution.

		types of variables:
		-> user defined variable

			set, select
		-> local variable -> procedures and function
		-> system variable

	operators
	expressions
	
	SQL:
	DDL: data definition lang.
		user,index, database.....
		
		create, drop, alter, truncate.

		create-> user-> root -> your own password (DBA) 

		user management :
		mysql -u shiva -p

		-> create user <username> identified by <password>;
		-> grant all privileges on *.* to <username>;
		-> flush privileges;
		-> revoke all privileges on *.* from '<username>';
		-> show grants for <username>;
		-> drop user <username>
		-> select user from mysql.user;
		-> select user();
		-> set password for <username>=password('password');
			OR
		-> update mysql.user set password=password('pwd') where user =<username>;
			OR
		-> alter user <username> identified by 'pwd';


		Database management:
		-> show databases;	
		-> create database <database_name>;
		-> create database if not exists <database_name>;
		-> use database_name;
		-> drop database database_name;
		-> mysqldump -u shiva -p personaldb > d:\hcl4\personaldb.sql

		table management:
		-> show tables;
		-> create table student(stdid int, stdname varchar(20),stdaddress varchar(30));

		-> desc <table-name>;
		-> alter table student add(stdmob bigint);
		-> alter table student drop stdmob;
		-> alter table student change column stdid studentid int;		
		-> alter table student rename to student420;	
		-> drop table tablename; ex-> drop table student420;
		-> truncate student;
		

		DML -> insert, update, delete, merge

		->insert into student values(12,'shiva','usa');
		->insert into student(stdname,stdaddress) values('kumar','UK');
		->update student set stdid=23,stdaddress='hyd' where stdname='kumar';
		->delete from student where stdid=23;

		->merge -> joins
